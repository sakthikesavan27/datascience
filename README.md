# Why Data Science is the New Electricity - A Project

This repository is a holistic submission for a Junior Data Scientist role, encompassing an essay, hands-on data analysis, and a role exploration.

## 1. Essay Insight
The essay argues that Data Science, like electricity, is a transformative, foundational utility that powers modern innovation. It is no longer a niche field but a pervasive force that optimizes processes, enables new capabilities, and provides a critical competitive advantage across all industries, from healthcare to governance. Its evolution from basic statistics to modern AI mirrors the development of electrical systems from simple circuits to a vast, essential grid.

## 2. Dataset Analysis
The project uses the **Heart Disease UCI** dataset from Kaggle.
- **Python Analysis (`analysis.ipynb`):** Handled missing values, found strong correlations (e.g., `thalach` vs. `target`), and visualized the distribution of age.
- **R Analysis (`analysis.r`):** Computed summary statistics for the `age` column and created a bar chart showing heart disease presence by sex.

## 3. Chosen Role
The role of **Data Scientist** was explored. This role focuses on extracting insights and building predictive models using statistical and machine learning techniques, requiring a blend of programming, math, and business acumen skills.
